“Pagbilan ngaa!”1 The seven year old child loudly knocked on the wooden sill with her change. “Chikinini…Pritos Ring…and a StarKist!”

“Don’t have.”

“StarKist?”

“Don’t have,” Rogelio didn’t even bother to look.

“I’ll just have a Rinbee, then.”

“Don’t have.”

“Not even Rinbee?” The child pouts. “How ‘bout Cheezums?”

“We don’t sell anymore,” Rogelio stands from his chair made of rattan to talk to the little girl. “Do you even see any wares around here?” He points to the child the broken TV’s, fans, radios, and other old machinery around him. The child pouts even deeper in dismay, while squinting with her left eye and playing with her bangs. Rogelio sits down again and returns to fiddling with the small Sony cassette player.

“Kuya2, do you have Lipps?” the child continued as if nothing happened.

“Don’t have.”

“Mr. Cinco?”

“Don’t have.”

“Texas?”

“Don’t have. I don’t have Texas.” He grabbed two bubble gums on top of the old jar of Lady’s Choice beside him and gave it to the kid. “But I have some Tarzan if you want. We’re cool?”

The girl happily took the free bubble gum, and after saying thanks immediately took off.
